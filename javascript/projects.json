When you sign up, you automatically follow all the main pages (Boulder, Canada, Australia) and all the registered peer mentors from your community. After signing in, the app automatically loads the feed page. From there, you can navigate throughout the app. There is an events page where you can scan a QR code to check in for each event. After checking in, users are asked to fill out a survey with the information needed for Natural Highs to apply for grants. The app has a database holding the demographics of each user along with their answers to surveys.",
