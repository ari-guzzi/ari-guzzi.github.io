        <h2>Hello! I'm Ari...</h2> 
        I'm pursuing a BS in Creative Technology and Design with a minor in Computer Science from the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
        My program combines creativity with engineering, focusing on critical thinking, problem-solving, design, and creative production.       
       <br>
        <br>
        During my time at CU Boulder, I've honed my ability to take constructive feedback and solve problems from diverse perspectives. 
        Beyond coursework, I've delved deep into my passions; am a part of a university club,  <a href="https://blueprintboulder.org/">Blueprint Boulder</a>, which builds apps and websites for nonprofits. 
        I am the <a href="appdes.html">head of front-end design</a> for a team developing a database for a nonprofit. This experience highlighted how technology fuels my creativity. 
        I've also enjoyed blending skills from various classes to tackle multifaceted projects.
        <br><br>
        I'm passionate about <a href="appdev.html">mobile apps</a>, 
        <a href="webdev.html">websites</a>, and 
        <a href="web.html">UI/UX</a>
        development. My Computer Science minor and extracurricular work have also made me confident in full-stack development.                
        <br> <br> 
        I was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado. When not working, I enjoy gardening, building apothecaries, embroidering, volunteering, and playing with my <a href="myhobbies.html">dog</a>!
