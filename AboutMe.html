        <h2>Hello! I'm Ari...</h2> 
        I'm pursuing a BS in Creative Technology and Design with a minor in Computer Science from the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
        This program blends creativity with an engineering curriculum, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, design, and creative production. 
        <br>
        <br>
        During my time at CU Boulder, I've not only sharpened my ability to receive and apply constructive criticism, but also honed my problem-solving skills, allowing me to approach challenges from diverse perspectives. 
        Beyond coursework, I've delved deep into my passions, I am the head of front-end development for a team in Blueprint Boulder, a CU club that builds apps and websites for nonprofits. We developed a database for a nonprofit. 
        This experience illuminated the pivotal role of technology in expressing my creativity. 
          Additionally, I've learned to merge various technological skills from different classes to drive cohesive, multifaceted projects.
        <br><br>
        I'm particularly drawn to front-end development, finding joy in projects related to mobile app, website, and UI/UX development. Through my computer science minor and extracurriculars, I became comfortable with full-stack development.
        <br> <br> 
          I was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado. When I am not working, I thoroughly enjoy gardening, building apothecaries, embroidering, volunteering, and playing with my dog!
