        <h2>Hello! I'm Ari...</h2> 
        I am a Front-End Developer with experience in Fullstack Web and iOS development. I worked at finish'd, Inc. as a Frontend (UI/UX) Software Development Intern and <a href="finishd.html">redesigned their app's UI</a>.
        I graduated from the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado Boulder with a BS in Creative Technology and Design with a minor in Computer Science. For my senior capstone project, I was the sole developer on <a href="capstone.html">a backpacking meal planner app</a>.
        <br><br>I graduated with <b>Magna Cum Laude</b> and two graduation awards from the College of Engineering and Applied Science: <b>The Perserverance Award</b> and <b>The Community Impact Award</b>.    
        <br><br> My background combines creativity with engineering, focusing on critical thinking, problem-solving, design, and creative production. Some of my coursework included Mobile Application Development, Advanced Front-End Web Development, Human-Computer Interaction, Intro to Virtual Reality, Tiny Games Creation, Principles of Programming Languages, and Computer Systems. 
       <br>
        <br>
        During my time at CU Boulder, I've refined my ability to embrace constructive feedback and approach problem-solving from diverse perspectives. 
        Beyond coursework, I've delved deep into my passions; I joined a university club,  <a href="https://blueprintboulder.org/">Blueprint Boulder</a>, which builds apps and websites for nonprofits. 
        I was the <a href="appdes.html">head of front-end design</a> for a team developing a database for a nonprofit, and the VP of Nonprofit Coordination.
        <br><br>
        I was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado. When not working, I enjoy gardening, building apothecaries, embroidering, volunteering, and playing with my <a href="myhobbies.html">dog</a>!
